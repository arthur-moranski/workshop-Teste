## How it works

When you turn on the switches, if you activate an even number, LED 0 will light up, but if it is an odd number, it will go out.

## How to test

turn on switch 1, the LED will turn off since only it is on, but if you turn on switch 2 it will stay off, then the left one will turn on

## External hardware

Basically, I used what's in the model, except for what's between the inputs and outputs. In this part, I used six XORs.
